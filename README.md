# Terminal Blue
## A place for my Powershell scripts to live.

Welcome to Terminal Blue. This is a personal project/repo for scripts I have made over time. This allows me to access them easily for reference or deploying.

### Side Notes
+ Anything with "DRAFT" in file name is an incompleted script with comments. Uploaded so I dont forget about it.

#### Disclaimer: By using these scripts on this github you are doing so at your own risk. Before using I highly recommend the following.
+ Testing on pre-prod/dev enviroment.
+ Ask permission of asset/network/domain owners to execute scripts before running them.
+  Ensure data being extracted/gathered has consent from data owners.

Thanks for reading.
